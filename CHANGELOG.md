# Changelog

As we learn, we start to understand the importance of certain things. (Like adding a changelog to keep track of important feature additions!)
However, I was not following this at first - so I am adding one now. So as to make this look a bit nicer. Since we aren't going to be adding any more features to this version of the game, this will instead just track our changes to the repo!
