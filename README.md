# Developer's Note

This game is currently inactive. I have migrated this to a newer version of Unity, and is additionally being redone in 3D instead of 2D. The source code of the newer version is and will not be publicly accessible (sorry)! However, this repo is being changed into something different. This will now instead have samples of different kinds of gameplay mechanics from the newer version, as well as some reasoning behind certain choices. Neon Rain is also a working title, not a finalized title. While this version is inactive, all old scripts are in the LEGACY folder! So all old code is going to be there. As ugly as it can be. The exception will be Editor tools which are in the Editor folder, as well as any packages which are in the Imports folder.

While the old code may not be pretty, it's nice to see sometimes how far we have come as developers! Additionally, I am unsure of how often this is going to be updated, but here and there - I will add more and more stuff.
